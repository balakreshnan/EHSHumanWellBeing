Employee or People monitor for human well being - Custom Vision

Given Covid 19 for now but it has been my life for past 4 years working from home or remote. It has been crazy hours of working and it has become hard to draw line between work and family. So my thought is how can i and all make it easier to improve health while working from home or remote. 

Options:

Alert if sitting and working for more than an hour. Make user stand or walk or move around.

Monitor and alert user when they go above certain threshold of hour for example if the employee has to work 10 hours and if he is going beyond that remind them gently to take  break for that day.

Look for any distress signs and alert authority.

Ability to report to HR on the well being

Based on HR policy validate if the user is following the guideline's for safety.

Ability to configure work hours with break, integrate with office 365 and teams. Can we gently alert user when they are in a team's meeting.

Check if the user is drinking water or any liquid (not alcohol) to make them hydrate.

Count the number of coffee or other beverages like Red bull or 5 hour energy and alert user if they are going over.

Alert user with their un taken time off and remind them how much they loose if they don't take it.

Ability to configure learning time and focus time and let user know once of twice a day about their progress to take a break and learn or create focus time.

If user is working is harsh condition are they safety precautions to follow and monitor them. Ability to customize regulation's based on industry regulation and apply them. For example for Covid having mask and social distancing can be enforced for employee safety. Some conpany might choose to follow 10 feet rather than 6 feet.

Find heart based or sudden distress in human and ability to alert management and emergency officials.
